    "# Data Effects - Scoped Side Effects and State in Penzai Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Penzai neural networks are conventionally written in terms of simpler combinators like `pz.nn.Sequential`, `pz.nn.Residual`, or `pz.nn.BranchAndAddTogether`, which run their child sublayers in order and route inputs and outputs between them. To make everything compose together, every Penzai layer takes a single input argument, which is usually the output of the previous layer in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "On its own, this has a few limitations. There are a number of common patterns in neural networks that cannot be expressed easily as compositions of single-input single-output functions. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attention masks and positional embeddings need to know the positions of each input token in addition to receiving inputs from their previous layers.\n",
    "- Stochastic layers like `Dropout` need to generate fresh random numbers.\n",
    "- Key-value caching in Transformer decoders need to save keys and values into a stateful cache.\n",
    "- Saving intermediate activations requires somehow retrieving those activations from the middle of the model.\n",
    "- Since models own their parameters as attributes, two layers that share parameters need to reference the *same* parameter value, so that gradients are properly shared between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few existing solutions to this, used by other JAX neural network frameworks:\n",
    "- You could have your layers be represented by *mutable* Python objects that store references to each other and to mutable variables, and transform these objects into pure functions when called.\n",
    "  - This approach is taken by Flax and Haiku.\n",
    "  - A disadvantage of this approach is that it becomes difficult to inspect or manipulate smaller parts of your model, and almost impossible to insert new logic without editing the model code.\n",
    "- You could require every module to \"thread through\" the necessary state and PRNG keys as arguments to each layer, and use custom `__call__` logic to match up these arguments and handle parameter sharing.\n",
    "  - This is the approach taken by Equinox.\n",
    "  - A disadvantage of this approach is that every submodule has to know about every argument needed by any of its children. So you can't easily insert e.g. new Dropout layers without changing every containing class to pass around random keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Penzai takes a different approach, building on the \"structure-encodes-computation\" principle of Penzai's neural networks , and loosely inspired by effect systems in functional programming languages. The key idea is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Represent requests for state, random numbers, or other \"effectful\" operations as **typed nodes in the model's PyTree**\n",
    "- And **handle those requests using ordinary PyTree traversals**, powered by `pz.select`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system makes effect handling modular, composable, and fully under your control. It's also fully opt-in. If your model doesn't use effects, then you don't have to think about the system, and it can't affect your model's behavior at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains how the system works, and shows how you can use it to flexibly pass data into and out of model layers while still making use of Penzai's ordinary combinators and utilities. It assumes familiarity with Penzai models and `pz.select`; if you haven't read it already, you might want to start with the [\"How to Think in Penzai\" tutorial](how_to_think_in_penzai.ipynb) first."
